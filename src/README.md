## Sources have changed place
The project sources have changed place.  
- You'll find themes that are only comprised of stylesheets under "stylesheets" project ("stylesheets" directory).  
- JMetro is under "jmetro" ("jmetro" directory)  
- Code samples, that show how to work with a theme and how controls look with that theme are under "samples" ("samples" directory)
